# Web-based Software Quality & Reliability Evaluation System

## Project Overview
This project is a Software Engineering CASE tool that performs static analysis on source code to evaluate software quality and assess reliability risks.

The web interface is used only for interaction. The core focus is on software engineering principles such as quality assurance, reliability analysis, and maintainability.

## Key Features
- Upload source code (ZIP)
- Static code analysis
- Quality metric computation
- Reliability risk assessment
- Downloadable analysis report

## Technology Stack
- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML, CSS
- GitHub for version control

## Software Engineering Artifacts
- Strategic Rationale (SR) Diagram
- Use Case Diagram
- Activity Diagram
- ER Diagram
- Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

## Team Members
